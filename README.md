# Articles Web Application

A simple web application for managing articles, where users can view a list of articles and add new ones. The application is built using PHP and Bootstrap, with the articles being stored in a JSON file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have:

**articles.json**: The project requires a file called `articles.json` in the root directory. This file will store the articles in JSON format. If the file doesn't exist, you can create an empty `articles.json` file.

## Running the Application

To start the application, use **php -S localhost:8000** or replace 8000 with any port of your choice.
